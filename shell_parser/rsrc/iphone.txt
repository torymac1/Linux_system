THE BRAND NEW IPHONE X -- THAT'S PRONOUNCED "TEN," BY THE WAY, NOT "EX" -- IS A PHONE OF FIRSTS FOR APPLE.

THE 5.8-INCH OLED SCREEN ISN'T JUST LARGER, IT ALSO USES A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY THAT APPLE SAYS WILL MAKE COLORS ABSOLUTELY POP.

IT'S ALSO THE FIRST IPHONE TO COMPLETELY DO AWAY WITH THE ICONIC HOME BUTTON.

AND THE FIRST TO OFFER FACE ID AS A NEW WAY TO SECURELY UNLOCK THE PHONE AND PAY IN THE CHECK-OUT LINE.

THE IPHONE X ALONE IS APPLE'S ONLY NEW DEVICE TO HAVE OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION ON BOTH REAR 12-MEGAPIXEL CAMERA LENSES, A PORTRAIT MODE ON THE FRONT-FACING CAMERA (DESPITE JUST ONE LENS AND NOT TWO), AND -- MORE BREEZILY -- A NEW FEATURE TO ANIMATE EMOJIS.

THESE ARE THE     DISTINGUISHING     FEATURES WE LOOKED AT WHEN GOING HANDS-ON WITH APPLE'S NEWEST,

LARGEST AND PRICIEST IPHONE AT APPLE'S EQUALLY NEW APPLE PARK HEADQUARTERS IN CUPERTINO,

CALIF. -- SEE FOR YOURSELF IN THE VIDEOS ABOVE     AND     BELOW.
